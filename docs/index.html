Studies of production include bots and bespoke code such as templates that frame subjects and direct editorial activity.

Reception studies analyse how users across the web who interact with Wikimedia data via search engines, social media platforms, chatbots, as well as galleries, libraries, archives, and museums interpret and make meaning from the Wikimedia data they encounter.</p>							</div>

								<p>We encourage researchers from different fields to discuss, debate, and conduct critical research about Wikimedia data. Importantly, new research questions demand that old methods be repurposed and that new methods be developed, ones that are sensitive to the diverse socio-technical situations of Wikimedia data and recognise its inherently qualitative and quantitative nature, thereby opening pathways for innovative mixed-methods research approaches These conditions make drawing on each other’s disciplinary strengths necessary to stay attentive to research gaps and methodological oversights.</p>							</div>

				<p>A manifesto for Wikimedia research was formulated at a meeting of critical, humanist Wikimedia researchers in Brisbane, 2024. We gathered to discuss Wikimedia’s changing role “and/as data” as Wikipedia and its sister sites have become increasingly important as a foundation of knowledge circulating via AI tools. We asked: “What would need to change in our research practice if we accepted that Wikimedia has become public knowledge infrastructure?”</p>			</div>

				<div class="paragraph text-gap-t">
					<p>Founded in 2001, Wikipedia quickly became one of the most critical sources of knowledge about the world, defining what counts as the consensus truth about people, places, events, and other phenomena for a generation. Over two decades later, Wikipedia has been joined by other sites under the Wikimedia banner, offering a range of free images, books, definitions and data and establishing the goal of becoming “essential infrastructure of the ecosystem of free knowledge” by 2030 (Wikimedia Foundation, <u><a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Movement_Strategy">2030 Movement Strategy</a></u>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In 2011, the Critical Point of View (CPoV) project established a new way of thinking about Wikipedia that emphasised the platform’s socio-cultural, political, and economic implications, calling for “an informed, radical critique from the inside.” Since then, Wikipedia (and other projects under the purview of Wikimedia) has become an accepted public resource of general information, a primary data source for knowledge graphs and now generative AI models.&nbsp;</p><p>Wikimedia projects are generally recognised as readily available data sources for public research and private extraction. But the circulation of this data without a critical understanding of how it is being produced can lead to Wikipedia’s socio-cultural biases becoming exacerbated. In an age where Wikimedia operates as public knowledge infrastructure, it is necessary to rekindle the critical spirit of CPoV i.e. where critique is in aid of specific understandings of current issues and problems, rather than wholesale, knee-jerk negativity or conservatism.&nbsp;</p><p>Recognising and investigating Wikimedia's implications for shaping public understanding of issues, debates, and controversies across various domains, we present 10 principles for Wikimedia researchers working to understand its role in the global information and knowledge ecosystem. The manifesto is a call to “Together, interrogate and reconstitute Wikimedia as public knowledge infrastructure”.</p>				</div>
